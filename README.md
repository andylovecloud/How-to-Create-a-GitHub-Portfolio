# 🤔 How-to-Create-a-GitHub-Portfolio

Hello there, I'm Andy! 🙋 This is a basic guide to create your GitHub portfolio for beginner.

### It's aim to :

👉🏻 Beginners in IT or whoever looking to showcase samples of work, or projects.

👉🏻 Build your digital resume to demonstrate your technical skills.

👉🏻 A fun and visualized way to track of your projects.


### Why I created this guideline 😊 ? 

I'm using Github while studying in University a lot, but don't know how to maximize the benefit of make it as my porfolio. I didn't understand how it worked and ended up leaving it aside.

However, since nearly at the end of my 2nd Bachelor (2024), I've become quite obsessed with writing in Markdowns 😆 and have learned how to use it. 

Now, I'm excited to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂

## Introduction

📌 **Repository (or repo)**: Fancy word for a folder. Think of it as your digital junk drawer, but way more organized. Each repo holds one project, so feel free to hoard as many as you like—no judgment!

📌 **README.md**: The repo’s welcome mat. It’s the first thing people see, so it’s your chance to dazzle them with a project summary, witty intro, or even your favorite dad jokes.

📌 **Fork**: The "Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V" of GitHub. You can copy someone’s repo, mess around with it, and pretend you're a genius coder. Don't worry, your edits stay in your sandbox—no repo owner rage here!

Oh, and guess what? You don’t need to download GitHub Desktop to get started. Your browser is all set to be your sidekick. No capes required. 😉
