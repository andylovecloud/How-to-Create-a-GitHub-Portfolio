# 🤔 How-to-Create-a-GitHub-Portfolio

Hello there, I'm Andy! 🙋 This is a basic guide to create your GitHub portfolio for beginner.

It's aim to :

👉🏻 Beginners in IT or whoever looking to showcase samples of work, or projects.
👉🏻 Build your digital resume to demonstrate your technical skills.
👉🏻 A fun and visualized way to track of your projects.


Why I created this guideline 😊 ? 

I'm using Github while studying in University a lot, but don't know how to maximize the benefit of make it as my porfolio. I didn't understand how it worked and ended up leaving it aside.
However, since nearly at the end of my 2nd Bachelor (2024), I've become quite obsessed with writing in Markdowns 😆 and have learned how to use it. Now, I'm excited to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂
